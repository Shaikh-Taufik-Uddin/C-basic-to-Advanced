This is not something new or anything .... simply keeping Track of my coding journey

👋 About Me

Hello! I’m Shaikh Taufik Uddin, a first-year Computer Science & Engineering student at JIS College of Engineering.
I come from Khardah, West Bengal, a quiet yet lively town where I grew up exploring technology and developing a love for learning.

📚 Education

10th Board – Khardah Shibnath High School
‣ Scored 95.43% and achieved All West Bengal (state) Rank 25

12th Board – Rahara Ramakrishna Mission
‣ Graduated with 93 percentile

These experiences taught me discipline, time management, and the importance of consistent effort.

💻 Tech Journey

I’ve always been a tech enthusiast — the friend everyone calls when their PC breaks or when they want advice on custom hardware.
My curiosity drives me to explore how hardware and software work together, from processors to algorithms.

I’m particularly interested in:

🖥️ Computer Hardware & Coding 

Currently, I’m focusing on strengthening my programming fundamentals and building small projects to document my learning journey here on GitHub.

🌱 What I Believe

“Knowledge grows when it’s shared.”

I enjoy helping others — whether it’s troubleshooting a technical issue, explaining a concept, or collaborating on projects.
College, to me, is about more than grades — it’s about collaboration, exposure, and creating meaningful memories with peers.

✨ Goals

I aspire to become a skilled engineer who can combine technology and creativity to build solutions that make life easier.
Over the next few years, I hope to:

Contribute to open-source projects

Work on applications & real world problems

Explore real-world problem-solving through technology

⚡ Fun Facts

Energetic , approachable, and always curious about how things work

A self-proclaimed “tech nerd” who loves tinkering with gadgets

Wizard 

Excited to explore new tools, frameworks, and coding challenges every day

🙌 Closing Note

Thank you for visiting my profile and joining me on this journey of learning, building, and sharing.
I’m looking forward to collaborating, contributing, and making these years memorable.
