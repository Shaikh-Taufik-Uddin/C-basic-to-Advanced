About myself

Hello everyone,
I am Shaikh Taufik Uddin, and it’s an honor to introduce myself as a first-year student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at JIS College of Engineering. I come from Khardah, a quiet yet lively town in West Bengal, where I have spent most of my life learning, growing, and shaping my interests.

Education has always been an important part of who I am. I completed my 10th board examinations from Khardah Shibnath High School, where I was fortunate enough to achieve 95.43% and secure an All West Bengal Rank of 25. Those results gave me confidence and pushed me to keep aiming higher. Later, I pursued my Higher Secondary education at Rahara Ramakrishna Mission, one of the most disciplined and respected institutions in our area, where I scored 93 percentile. My journey through school taught me not just academics but also discipline, time management, and the value of hard work.

Now that I have stepped into the world of engineering, I see it as a brand-new chapter filled with challenges, opportunities, and learning. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology — how it evolves, how machines think, and how innovation changes the way we live. I would say I’m a bit of a tech nerd. I love exploring computer hardware, trying out new gadgets, and understanding what goes on inside the systems we use every day. This curiosity is what drew me toward Computer Science and Engineering. I want to learn not just how computers work, but how they can be made to work better — smarter, faster, and more efficiently.

Apart from academics, I consider myself a person who enjoys helping others. Whether it’s solving a technical problem, sharing notes, or explaining a concept, I always try to contribute in whatever way I can. I believe knowledge grows only when shared, and I genuinely enjoy being part of that process. It gives me a sense of satisfaction when someone benefits from something I explained or taught.

 I have always been that “tech nerd” among my friends — the one people turn to when their computers crash or when they need help building a custom PC. I enjoy exploring how hardware and software work hand-in-hand to create the digital world around us. My curiosity often drives me to learn new things — from understanding how processors function, to exploring programming logic and artificial intelligence. I believe that technology, when used rightly, has the power to simplify life and solve real-world problems, and I wish to be a part of that transformation.

Personality-wise, I’m a calm, approachable, and positive person. I like meeting new people and learning about their experiences. I feel college is not just about degrees or grades — it’s about building relationships, gaining exposure, and learning how to work with others. Over the next four years, I want to make memories that last — working on projects, participating in events, and creating something meaningful with my fellow classmates.

When I think about the future, I see myself becoming a skilled engineer who can contribute something valuable to society. My dream is to combine my passion for technology with creativity to build solutions that make people’s lives easier. I’m particularly interested in fields like AI, cybersecurity, and computer hardware design, and I’m excited to explore them in depth during my college journey.

To sum up, I see myself as someone who is curious, hardworking, and ready to learn. I am thankful to my professors, mentors, and new friends who will accompany me in this journey ahead. I look forward to these wonderful four years at JIS College of Engineering — learning, growing, and creating memories that I’ll cherish forever.

Thank you for listening to my introduction.
